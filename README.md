This application is a webpage that shows the weather for any city that the user wants to look up. It shows immediate conditions, a 5 day forecast and then saves searched cities to be researched again for quick comparrison

## Usage

This application is very simple to use and easy to understand. In the top left of the screen there is a seach bar labled, "Search for a City:" and with the placeholder "New York" to show users how to input city names and especially city names with multiple words. Once the name of a city is typed the user can either press the enter key or click the "Search" button to populate the rest of the page with weather information for the chosen city. On the right side of the screen the user will see, on top, weather for the current day, and on the bottom, they will see a forecast for the next 4 days giving you the 5 day weather forecast. The city name will then be saved as a clickable button in the "Search History" section of the page. If one of the city buttons is clicked that city is called again and the weather information is displayed on the page

## Technology

This application makes use of basic HTML, CSS, CSS Grid, JavaScript, as well as the Open Weather Api:
